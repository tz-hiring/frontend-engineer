# Technical Assessment: Card Component Implementation

## Overview
Welcome to the technical assessment for the  Frontend Engineer (design focus) position. The task is to build a `Card` component based on the Figma design provided. This assessment will test your attention to detail, semantic HTML usage, CSS proficiency, and adherence to best practices.

The repository has been set up with all the assets and tooling you'll need to complete the assessment. 

 We advise you take the first few minutes to read the instructions and go through the Figma files, especially if you are not very familiar with the tool.

 **Time allocated**: 1 hour 30 minutes 

**Figma:** [Frontend Engineer Assessment - Design](https://www.figma.com/design/Fe8lmciEWMnjq5Auyg4H9k/FE-Assessment?node-id=5-16&t=b9lSbNpnNy92yPTH-1)

## Getting Started

To install package dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the local dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

The repository provided contains the following pre-installed and configured:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Modules
- All assets needed for the design in the `/public` folder
- [IBM UI icons library](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/ui-icons/library/)

Whilst we have done this to help you dive straight into the assessment, we encourage you to use whatever tooling or stack you feel most comfortable with.

 If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out to us.  Have fun and good luck!

## Instructions
Please go to the **Assessment** page in the Figma link above. The assessment contains 5 steps, each with an increasing level of complexity. The first step is mandatory; you may choose which (if any) of the optional tasks to complete if you have additional time after completing this step. Please note we are only concerned with the `Card` component. 

**Step 1 (Mandatory)**. Build the `Card` as specified in the design.

**Step 2 (Optional)**.  Add hover and focus states to the `Card` component built in Step 1. Step 2 contains two designs, the first one representing the hover state and the second representing the focus state.

**Step 3 (Optional)**. Observe the **Like** icon with a count at the bottom of the component. Step 3 is to implement a Click interaction such that the like count is incremented by one and the the colour changes to red (per the design). Clicking on it again should decrement the like count and remove the applied colour.

**Step 4 (Optional)**. On clicking the card, it should open [`transitionzero.org`](http://transitionzero.org) in a new tab. (**HINT:** Pay attention to accessibility).

**Step 5 (Optional)**. Per the design, add the gradient to the focus state of the card.
